When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

We would to user a remote repository in differents situations.
  When the project is a collaborate project with different persons, maybe who are from differents locations, and need to do committing each day.
  When you have a very important project, and you donÂ´t want to lose information, you want to have a backup about your project.
  When you want to have, all your project in a same location, but when you need to see a old develop software then you can see easily.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the repository have to have the more recently changes in all project, for the collaborates can have a update project.
	Is not necessary commit all changes, only who have signification changes
