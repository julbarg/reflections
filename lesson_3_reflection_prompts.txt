When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

We would to user a remote repository in diferents situations.
  When the project is a collorabite project with diferent persons, maybe who are from diferents locations, and need to do commiting each day.
  When you have a very important project, and you donÂ´t want to lose information, you want to have a backup about your project.
  When you want to have, all your project in a same location, but when you need to see a old develop software then you can see easly.
